- Idea: Start with the largest coin denominations first, subtract their values from the total until
    * remaining amount is zero or
    * no more possible combinations exist

(This is a greedy approach)


For example:
Total is 1002:
Denominations : 1000 and 1
Coins will be 1 * 1000 and 2 * 1
Why? 1002 - 1000 (largest denomination) = 2 rem
     2 - 1 (largest possible denomination) = 1 rem
     1 - 1 (largest possible denomination) = 1 rem

Approach:
1. Sort the coins in descending order
2. Start subtracting from the largest possible denomination.
3. Subtract next largest possible denomination from the remainder.
4. Continue until the total is 0 or if no other possible combination exists.
